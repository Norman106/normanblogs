# Tips for Improving API Performance in ASP.NET Core

**Tags:** `#aspnet` `#dotnet` `#performance` `#webperf`

APIs are the backbone of modern applications, but even the cleanest code can drag if performance isn‚Äôt top of mind.

Very often, I receive this question after a session at an event or work from my colleagues: **How can I improve or ensure that my APIs are fast?**

These aren‚Äôt theoretical tips, they‚Äôre battle-tested improvements I‚Äôve used (and seen developers forget all too often).

Oh, and yes, we‚Äôll even let GitHub Copilot take a shot at refactoring for speed.

## 1. Use Asynchronous Requests Properly

In .NET, asynchronous programming isn't just a nice-to-have‚Äîit's a **must** for scalable APIs. Blocking calls can choke your thread pool, delay responses, and reduce overall throughput. Fortunately, ASP.NET Core makes writing async code pretty painless.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you see `.Result` or `.Wait()` in your code, chances are you‚Äôre leaving performance on the table‚Äîor worse, risking deadlocks.

**Bad (Blocking):**
```csharp
[HttpGet("weather")]
public IActionResult GetWeather()
{
    var forecast = _weatherService.GetForecast().Result;
    var log = _dbContext.Logs.FirstOrDefault();
    return Ok(new { forecast, log });
}
```

**Good (Async All The Way):**
```csharp
[HttpGet("weather")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetWeather()
{
    var forecast = await _weatherService.GetForecastAsync();
    var log = await _dbContext.Logs.FirstOrDefaultAsync();
    return Ok(new { forecast, log });
}
```

> üí° Tip: Always make the entire call chain async‚Äîfrom controller to service to data layer.

## 2. Use Pagination for Large Data Collections

Returning thousands of records in a single API call is one of the fastest ways to tank performance. Pagination helps by delivering data in manageable chunks.

```csharp
[HttpGet("products")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetProducts([FromQuery] int page = 1, [FromQuery] int pageSize = 20)
{
    var products = await _dbContext.Products
        .Skip((page - 1) * pageSize)
        .Take(pageSize)
        .ToListAsync();

    return Ok(products);
}
```

**Bonus: Return Pagination Metadata**
```csharp
var totalCount = await _dbContext.Products.CountAsync();
return Ok(new {
    data = products,
    pagination = new {
        currentPage = page,
        pageSize,
        totalCount
    }
});
```

## 3. Use AsNoTracking Whenever Possible

By default, EF Core tracks every entity it loads. That‚Äôs unnecessary for read-only operations and adds overhead.

```csharp
// Optimized with no tracking
var products = await _dbContext.Products
    .AsNoTracking()
    .ToListAsync();
```

### Combine With Projection
```csharp
var productList = await _dbContext.Products
    .AsNoTracking()
    .Select(p => new ProductDto {
        Id = p.Id,
        Name = p.Name,
        Price = p.Price
    })
    .ToListAsync();
```

>  [UPDATE]: With projections, `.AsNoTracking()` is implicit, so it's not strictly required.

---

## 4. Enable Gzip or Brotli Compression

Compressing your responses can dramatically reduce payload size, especially for JSON-heavy APIs.

>  It uses CPU resources for each request, so use with care!

**Setup:**
```csharp
builder.Services.AddResponseCompression(options =>
{
    options.EnableForHttps = true;
    options.Providers.Add<BrotliCompressionProvider>();
    options.Providers.Add<GzipCompressionProvider>();
});

builder.Services.Configure<BrotliCompressionProviderOptions>(opts =>
{
    opts.Level = CompressionLevel.Fastest;
});

builder.Services.Configure<GzipCompressionProviderOptions>(opts =>
{
    opts.Level = CompressionLevel.SmallestSize;
});

app.UseResponseCompression();
```

ASP.NET Core will prefer Brotli if the client supports it.

---

## 5. Use Cache for Frequently Accessed Data

Stop reloading the same data on every request. Use `IMemoryCache` or `IDistributedCache` to improve response time and reduce DB load.

**In-Memory Example:**
```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;
    private readonly AppDbContext _db;

    public ProductService(IMemoryCache cache, AppDbContext db)
    {
        _cache = cache;
        _db = db;
    }

    public async Task<List<Product>> GetFeaturedProductsAsync()
    {
        return await _cache.GetOrCreateAsync("featured_products", async entry =>
        {
            entry.AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
            return await _db.Products
                .Where(p => p.IsFeatured)
                .AsNoTracking()
                .ToListAsync();
        });
    }
}
```

For distributed environments, use Redis (there is also a Redis service on Azure).

## 6. Avoid Overfetching With Proper DTOs

Entities often contain fields your frontend doesn't need, and shouldn‚Äôt see.

**Entity vs DTO**
```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string InternalCode { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    public bool IsArchived { get; set; }
}

public class ProductDto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

**Query with DTO**
```csharp
var products = await _dbContext.Products
    .AsNoTracking()
    .Select(p => new ProductDto
    {
        Id = p.Id,
        Name = p.Name
    })
    .ToListAsync();
```

## 7. Ask GitHub Copilot to Refactor Your Code (Agent Mode )

Copilot isn‚Äôt just for boilerplate, it can help you spot real performance issues.

**Example Prompts**
- "Analyze this ASP.NET Core controller and suggest improvements for performance."
- "Refactor this service class to reduce database queries, avoid overfetching, and use caching."

Copilot can detect blocking calls, suggest `.AsNoTracking()`, promote pagination, and even refactor long service methods.

>  The more specific your prompt, the better the result.
