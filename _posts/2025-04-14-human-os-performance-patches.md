# Human OS: 18 Performance Patches for Engineers Who Want to Play the Long Game

> _"You have the power to change your life. Take small steps every day, and soon you’ll be unstoppable."_  
> — Inspired by Olly J

In tech, we’re used to optimizing systems, whether it's the code we write, the performance of our apps, or the infrastructure we manage. But when it comes to life, we often overlook the opportunity to optimize ourselves. The truth is: you can engineer a high-leverage life, just like you engineer scalable systems and efficient code.

The key is to develop and maintain high-performance habits — the small steps and tools that create exponential results. Below are 18 "cheat codes" that will help you jump 10 years ahead, without burning out. Think of it as building your own personal operating system for peak performance.

---

## 1. Master Your Sleep First (Seriously)

Sleep isn’t a luxury — it’s an optimization step.  
Imagine trying to run an app with insufficient memory or CPU power. It’s no different for your brain and body.

- **7–9 hours of quality sleep** is essential for cognitive function, focus, and emotional resilience.
- Stick to a **consistent sleep schedule**: same bedtime and wake-up time. Your body loves rhythm.
- Use wearables like **Oura Ring** or **Whoop** to track and optimize your sleep quality. If it’s measurable, it’s improvable.

**Why It Works:** Sleep impacts everything — from productivity to decision-making to your physical health. Treat it like a production system with monitoring and tuning.

## 2. Build a Minimum Viable Day (MVD)

High performers don't rely on bursts of motivation — they rely on their systems. Build a "minimum viable day" (MVD) that ensures progress even on bad days.

- Focus on **3–5 non-negotiable habits**. Think of them like core functionalities in your daily workflow.
  - **Workout** (movement = energy)
  - **30 minutes of deep work** (focus time)
  - **Walk outside** (refresh your mind)
  - **Sleep by 10 PM** (reset for tomorrow)

**Why It Works:** The MVD isn’t about perfection, it’s about consistency. When you can rely on a baseline, even tough days don’t derail your long-term goals.

## 3. Dopamine Detox Every Sunday

In the modern digital age, we’re constantly inundated with distractions, from social media to endless content. Every Sunday, take a **dopamine detox** to reset your brain.

- **Cut out all distractions**: no social media, no Netflix, no junk food.
- **Embrace boredom** — this is when your creativity and problem-solving abilities can flourish.

**Why It Works:** We’re not meant to be on constant information overload. This reset helps you regain mental clarity, improve focus, and spark creativity. Think of it as clearing cache files that slow down your system.

## 4. Protect Your AM Bandwidth Like a Firewall

The mornings are your most valuable, undistracted hours. Think of your morning focus as "protected" — no interference allowed.

- **No calls, meetings, or messages before 10 AM.**
- Mornings are for creation — not consumption.

**Why It Works:** Deep work is a high-leverage skill that is best done when you’re fresh. Mornings provide uninterrupted time to create, code, or problem-solve without the noise of daily tasks. Guard this like you would critical infrastructure.

## 5. Follow Energy, Not Money

Sustainability over brute force. If your work drains you, no amount of money will keep you going long-term.

- **Follow what energizes you**: Ask yourself, "What makes me feel alive?" and do more of that.
- Optimize for **long-term energy**, not just short-term discipline.

**Why It Works:** Motivation will fluctuate, but energy is your constant. When you focus on what sustains you, you build a more reliable foundation for success.

## 6. Curate Your Inputs Like Dependencies

Just like how you manage dependencies in a project, you must manage your inputs — what you consume (media, people, information) shapes your mindset and focus.

- Regularly **audit your media**: podcasts, YouTube channels, books, social media feeds, and even friends.
- **Cut out toxic or irrelevant inputs** that drain your energy or distract you from your goals.

**Why It Works:** Your brain absorbs everything it encounters. By curating the right information and surrounding yourself with inspiring people, you optimize your mental environment for success.

## 7. Build a Personal Board of Directors

Success is often about who you surround yourself with. Your personal board of directors consists of 3–5 individuals who inspire, challenge, and hold you accountable.

- They don’t need to be "official." You can have mentors, peers, or even inspirational figures.
- Make sure you're **listening** to them, learning from them, and leveraging their perspectives.

**Why It Works:** A diverse board will give you different perspectives, feedback, and ideas that help you grow. Even lone wolves need a team to avoid blind spots.

## 8. The Rule of 100

To master a skill or accomplish something, **do it 100 times**.

- **100 cold emails**, **100 YouTube videos**, **100 workouts** — quantity breeds quality.
- Most people quit too early. When you hit 100, you've learned far more than you think.

**Why It Works:** Repetition improves skill. It also helps you build resilience and consistency, two key components for long-term success.

## 9. Automate the Unimportant

You don’t need to be involved in every little detail. Automate, delegate, or eliminate tasks that don’t contribute to your mission.

- Use **automation tools** like Zapier, Notion, or Google Scripts to remove manual work.
- If it doesn’t move you closer to your goal or energize you, **automate it**.

**Why It Works:** Time is your most limited resource. Automating repetitive tasks allows you to focus your attention on high-leverage work — the things that drive real value.

## 10. Close Open Loops — Fast

Open loops, whether tasks or unfinished business, drain your mental resources.

- **Implement a One-Touch Rule**: If a task takes less than 2 minutes to complete, do it immediately.
- Keep track of larger tasks in a task manager and ensure you don’t leave open loops lying around.

**Why It Works:** When you close loops quickly, you clear mental bandwidth. This improves focus, reduces stress, and increases your productivity.

## 11. Build a Focus Temple

Designate one space in your environment strictly for deep work — a physical "temple" for your mind.

- No social media. No eating. No distractions.
- Create a **ritual** for this space: when you enter, it’s game time.

**Why It Works:** Creating a physical space for deep work trains your brain to associate that location with focus, just like a debugger automatically triggering when you hit a breakpoint.

## 12. Ask Better Questions

Questions drive everything. Instead of asking "Why is this happening to me?", ask yourself questions that drive growth.

- "What is this teaching me?"
- "How can I use this challenge to improve?"
- "What does the solution look like?"

**Why It Works:** Great questions lead to better insights. By framing challenges as opportunities, you shift your mindset and unlock solutions faster.

## 13. Weekly Review = Life’s Retrospective

The best developers and teams hold regular retrospectives to learn and improve. Do the same for your life.

- **Set aside 1 hour every Sunday** to review the past week.
- Reflect on what went well, what could be better, and plan your upcoming week.

**Why It Works:** This practice ensures you stay on track, identify bottlenecks, and continue iterating on your approach.

## 14. Master Assertive Communication

Clear communication is an underrated skill. As a leader, developer, or entrepreneur, learning to communicate assertively will set you apart.

- **Delegate confidently**, **push back on unreasonable demands**, and **speak with authority**.
- Being clear avoids misunderstandings and builds respect.

**Why It Works:** Strong communication avoids wasted time and energy, ensuring you and your team are aligned and productive.

## 15. Build a Daily Silent Hour

In an age of constant noise, your mind needs time to process and reflect.

- **One hour a day**: No phone. No music. No talking.
- Just thinking, journaling, walking, or reflecting.

**Why It Works:** Silence breeds insight. This hour of solitude gives your brain the time it needs to process information and make clearer decisions.

## 16. Walk 10,000 Steps Daily

Walking is one of the simplest and most effective productivity tools available.

- It **boosts creativity**, clears mental clutter, and keeps your body healthy.
- Use walking as time for reflection, brainstorming, or even informal meetings.

**Why It Works:** Walking enhances both physical and mental health. It’s a low-barrier form of exercise that boosts your productivity and energy levels.

## 17. Default to Action

Motion beats analysis. Inaction breeds anxiety.

- If you’re stuck between thinking and acting — act.
- Start small, test quickly, and iterate.

**Why It Works:** Action generates momentum. The more you execute, the clearer the path becomes.

## 18. Build a 5-Year Vision → Reverse Engineer It

Without a destination, you’ll wander aimlessly. Build your roadmap.

- **Write down your 5-year vision**: What does your ideal life look like?
- **Reverse engineer** it: What does your "future self" do today?

**Why It Works:** Having a clear vision gives you direction. By breaking it down into actionable steps, you can start building your future right now.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

We often wait for the "perfect" moment or for motivation to strike. But the truth is, high performance isn’t about inspiration; it’s about systems.

Start small. Stay consistent.  
Optimize relentlessly.  
And build your life like you’d build a world-class product.
